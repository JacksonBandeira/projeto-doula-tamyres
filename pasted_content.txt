I need you to create a static, responsive, and creative website using only pure HTML, CSS, and JavaScript (no frameworks or libraries). The site is for a professional doula named Tamyres Lima, and it must be written entirely in Brazilian Portuguese.

🔧 Technical Requirements:
Use semantic HTML optimized for basic SEO.

CSS must be clean and organized, with variables for colors and reusable styles.

JavaScript should be pure and used for interactivity (e.g., testimonial carousel and mobile menu).

All code must be clearly commented to help beginners understand and customize it.

Ensure full responsiveness using Flexbox and CSS Grid (mobile → tablet → desktop).

Include smooth animations (hover effects, fade-in, slide-in).

No backend — the contact form is front-end only.

Include direct links to WhatsApp and Instagram.
